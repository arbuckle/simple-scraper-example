This is an example of a very simple webpage scraper.  It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the webpage, so be sure you have that package installed.

It's designed to be tested against the web page presented at http://CatTo5k.com/target.htm

When run, it will download the page, parse some of the data out from the table on the webpage, and write that data to a file.


Two functions make this happen:

get_page(url) - this opens the webpage and returns the source code
soup_it(source) - this takes the source code and uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse specific data from it.

The functions are called at the bottom of the file.
